Whatever he earned as a lawyer, he spent on the needy widows helping them with their monthly rations, paying for school fees of their children, and paying for marriage of a number of Muslim girls. Most of his actions aptly reflected his pet name “Lala” (elder brother). He always rose above the base human weakness of cast, creed & religion. This is alas also the key reason for his death. His protests against terrorism carried weight with the masses. This, the terrorists could not afford.
